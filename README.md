flickrgrabr
===========

Quick hack to get your original images back from your Flickr photostream, if you're lucky. 

# Usage

    python flickrgrabr.py <first page of stream>

    For example:
        python flickrgrab.py http://www.flickr.com/photos/homatthew/12267802976
    ... if you were homatthew

# Background

I found out I have an old Flickr photostream that contains some photos that I took long ago with my BlackBerry Pearl. I didn't have copies anywhere else, so I wanted to download them. 

I didn't look too hard, but it seems that you can't get your originals back out of Flickr in bulk via the Flickr web UI. My searches turned up some binary apps that will download the originals for you, but being the skeptical sort that I am, I figured I would just write a Python script to do it. 

## Note

This script works for me, but it's brittle. I tested it out on some of the top Flickr photostreams and it didn't work. Maybe premium accounts' pages are formatted differently. Once it worked for my photo streams, I stopped working on it :)

# Disclaimer

Use at your own risk. I take no responsibility for how you use this script. This script was honestly designed to help me, a Flickr user whose copywrighted photos are stuck on Flickr servers, and maybe other folks in my situation. If by some miracle these folks come across this project when googling for solutions. Please don't use it to steal others' photos without permission.
